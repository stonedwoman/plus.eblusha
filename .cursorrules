## Cursor agent rules (project-local)
#
# Workflow:
# - After any code change that affects the repo, create a commit and push it to the current branch.
# - Do NOT commit/push generated artifacts (e.g. dist/, frontend/dist/, installers) unless explicitly requested.
# - Do NOT commit/push secrets (.env, API keys, tokens). If a secret is exposed, rotate it and remove from history.
# - If a change is read-only (no repo modifications), no commit/push is needed.
#
# Git:
# - Prefer small, focused commits with clear messages.
# - Run the relevant build/typecheck when reasonable before pushing.
